    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While I assume some familiarity with the basics of reinforcement and inverse reinforcement learning, here's a short overview (so feel free to skip this part if you already know them):\n",
    "In both settings, we describe our world using a Markov decision process (MDP).\n",
    "A MDP is a 5-tuple $(S, A, T, r, \\gamma)$ with states $S$, actions $A$, transition model $T(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = p(s_{t+1} \\mid s_t, a_t)$, reward function $r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and reward discount factor $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ decreasing the reward over time (where $a_t \\in A$ and $s_t, s_{t+1} \\in S$).\n",
    "In the inverse reinforcement learning setting we will only use per-state rewards $r(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "The key part of an MDP is that any action only relies on the current state, meaning complete independence of all of the preceding history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to find an optimal sequence of actions, i.e. a policy describing the optimal action per state, for an autonomous agent given a reward signal $r$.\n",
    "The reward signal provides feedback to the agent, affirming its behavior on actions that help further the goal of the task at hand, and punishing it on actions that are counter-productive to this goal.\n",
    "Policies come in two flavors: deterministic and stochastic.\n",
    "Deterministic policies are defined as function $\\pi: S \\to A$, whereas stochastic policies are defined as probability distributions over actions, i.e. $\\pi(a \\mid s)$.\n",
    "While in the usual RL setting the (or at least one) optimal policy is guaranteed to be deterministic, in inverse reinforcement learning (and not only there), it also makes sense to talk about stochastic policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), as the name states, does exactly the inverse of RL.\n",
    "Given demonstrations of an expert (agent), consisting of trajectories $\\tau = \\left( (s_0, a_0), (s_1, a_1), \\ldots, (s_{n-1}, a_{n-1}), s_n \\right)$ through the state-action space, IRL aims to recover the underlying reward function which explains the behavior of the expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow for computation with states, we use so-called features.\n",
    "Features are, in this case, defined as a function $\\phi: S \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$, mapping states to $d$-dimensional vectors, and can be arbitrarily chosen.\n",
    "In general, we assume that $\\phi(\\tau) = \\sum_{t = 0}^{|\\tau|} \\phi(s_t)$ where $|\\tau|$ denotes the length of the trajectories (visited states), i.e. that the features of a trajectory $\\tau$ are the sum of the features of the states visited by this trajectory, counting repetitions."

    "### The Principle of Maximum Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning is based on feature-expectation matching [\\[Abbel & Ng 2004\\]](#References):\n",
    "The expected visitation-frequency of features in the demonstrations provided by the expert should equal the exected visitation-frequency of features visited by the agent following the recovered reward function.\n",
    "In other words: The features describing the states of our world should be, in expectance, visited equally often by the agent following our recovered reward function and by the expert demonstrating (nearly) optimal behavior.\n",
    "In equations, we can express this as the expectation of features $\\phi$ over trajectories $\\tau$ derived from the reward we want to recover, and \n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "    \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi^L}[\\phi(\\tau)] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi^E}[\\phi(\\tau)],\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the learner follows a policy $\\pi^L$ directly implied by the reward.\n",
    "The expert follows an implicit policy $\\pi^E$ that encodes its notion of reward and optimality.\n",
    "Note that we can also express the expected feature visitation frequency as sum over trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "    \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi^L}[\\phi(\\tau)] = \\sum_{\\tau} p_{\\pi^L}(\\tau) \\phi(\\tau)\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "with the probability distribution $p_{\\pi^L}(\\tau)$ of trajectories of the learner. Finding such a match, however, is not a well-posed problem in accordance to the definition by Hadamard: There is not the single one, but many possible solutions.\n",
    "Multiple reward functions can achieve the same expected feature-visitation frequency [\\[Ng et al. 99; Abbel & Ng 2004; Ziebart 2010\\]](#References).\n",
    "To resolve this ambiguity, Ziebart et al. [\\[Ziebart et al. 2008\\]](#References). propose to choose the solution (i.e. the $p_{\\pi^L}$) maximizing the entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why should we maximize the entropy?\n",
    "To answer this, we have to understand what entropy represents.\n",
    "First of all, the entropy $H(p)$ of some event probability distribution $p$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "    H(p)\n",
    "    = -\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} p(x) \\log_2 p(x)\n",
    "    = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} p(x) \\cdot \\log_2 \\frac{1}{p(x)},\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the set containing all events $x$ and $p(x)$ the probability of event $x$ occurring.\n",
    "Let us now assume that we want to communicate the occurrence of all events $x$ with some other party in an efficient manner.\n",
    "To do this, we want to minimize the expected message length, so messages that will be sent frequently should be short, and messages that will be sent almost never are allowed to be long.\n",
    "Following this trail of thought leads to the term $h(x) = \\log_2(1/p(x))$, which is the optimal number of bits that we should spend on the message representing event $x$.\n",
    "With lower probability $p(x)$, the term $\\log_2(1/p(x))$ increases.\n",
    "In fact it increases logarithmically, as with more bits available, we can encode exponentially more events.\n",
    "Using this observation for the entropy $H$ then yields nothing more than the entropy being the lower limit of the expected message length over all messages, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "    H(p)\n",
    "    = \\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\\left[h(x)\\right].\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is in fact the underlying principle of Huffman coding (which, due to this relation, is guaranteed to be optimal9.\n",
    "As is done generally, we instead of the logarithm to base two use the normal logarithm.\n",
    "Since $\\log_2(x) = \\log(x)/\\log(2)$ holds, we are only dropping a constant factor of $\\log(2)$ which does not impact extremas or our reasoning below, and simplifies further computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let us ask again:\n",
    "Why should we maximize the entropy?\n",
    "Now we can give a simple reasoning [\\[Jaynes 1957\\]](#References):\n",
    "Let us assume that we have two distributions, $p_1$ and $p_2$, with entropies $H(p_1) > H(p_2)$.\n",
    "From our previous observations, we know now that to encode messages from $p_1$ we, in expectancy, need more bits than to encode messages from $p_2$.\n",
    "This is the key point, because this in turn also means that we have less information about $p_1$ than about $p_2$.\n",
    "If we know more about a distribution, we need less bits to encode events from it.\n",
    "If we know everything, we do not need to send/encode anything, and if we know nothing, we need to send everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "But isn't it good if we know more? The less entropy the better, right? you may ask.\n",
    "No.\n",
    "Not for many optimization problems:\n",
    "Consider a problem, like feature-expectation matching, which has many solutions fullfilling our constraints.\n",
    "The only information which we give our solver for this problem is the feature-expectations we want to replicate.\n",
    "All solutions provided by our solver contain this information.\n",
    "Yet they most certainly have a different entropy values.\n",
    "This must mean that (at least) some solutions have additional information that we did not provide, i.e. they have a bias.\n",
    "By choosing the solution with maximum entropy, we choose the solution with minimal information.\n",
    "Note that all solutions already satisfy our constraints, thus we actually choose the solution that fits our information with a minimal bias."
